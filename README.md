## Data Sources and Project Ideas
#### Idea 1:
[ACLED data from Palestine and Israel](acled-data.csv.zip) - [Source](https://acleddata.com/myacled) <br>
[Israeli communities, settlements, and outposts data](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ebaa8bd16ede4ec39f5564cb75e7501d)
* Is Israeli settler violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank concentrated in specific areas (i.e. around Settlements, etc.)?
