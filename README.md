## Data Sources and Project Ideas
### Idea 1:
[Israeli communities, settlements, and outposts data](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ebaa8bd16ede4ec39f5564cb75e7501d) <br>
[Israeli settler violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank CSV](settler-violence-map-data-fatalities.csv) - [Source](https://acleddata.com/myacled) <br>
Is Israeli settler violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank concentrated in specific areas (i.e. around Settlements, etc.)?

### Idea 2:
[ACLED data Palestine and Israel (2016 - present)](acled-data.csv.zip) - [Source](https://acleddata.com/myacled) <br>
#### Idea 2.1:
Do the areas where the largest numbers of Palestinian civilian fatalities occur differ based on Israeli actor type?
#### Idea 2.2:
I could do some additional research into statistical indicators of genocide and (likely using additional datasets) use the data to analyze the events in Gaza (this may be a wider scope than is feasible for this project).

### Idea 3:
[Education facilities in Palestine](hotosm_pse_education_facilities_points_geojson.zip) <br>
[ACLED data Palestine and Israel (2016 - present)](acled-data.csv.zip) - [Source](https://acleddata.com/myacled) <br>
I saw an article a while back discussing students being targeted by Israeli occupation forces around schools, it could be interesting to look more into that (I know that I cannot determine intent, but it would still be interesting to look at civilian targeting incidents in the vicinity of schools. <br>

### Idea 4:
[Forced home demolitions in Palestine (2004 - 2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/home-demolitions-in-palestine-20042021) <br>
#### Idea 4.1:
[ACLED data Palestine and Israel (2016 - present)](acled-data.csv.zip) - [Source](https://acleddata.com/myacled) <br>
Is there a correlation between number of the number of yearly home demolitions and civilian targeting events in each governorate? <br>
#### Idea 4.2
[Israeli settler violence against Palestinian civilians CSV](settler-violence-map-data-fatalities.csv) - [Source](https://acleddata.com/myacled) <br>
Is there a correlation between number of the number of yearly home demolitions and events of settler violence against Palestinians?

### Idea 5:
[Aid worker security database (Palestine 2002 - 2025)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/aid-worker-security-database-pse)
